            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/me.png" alt="Picture of Chris Boodaghian" width ="20%" height = "25%">
            <p>
                I am currently a student at Ramapo College of New Jersey majoring in computer science. But that doesn't stop me from coding, I freelance on the side and also design games, websites, and apps.  
            I am located in New Jersey and have a passion for coding. I plan on becoming a full-time developer after I get my masters in computer science. Whenever I have time, I make fun websites and games that are being tested right now. 

            </p>
                <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Ever since I was 13 years old, programming was introduced to me by my cousin. At that time, I have always wanted to know how to operate all of those ones and zeros that you see in the movies. I eventually started learning code on free coding websites until I found Thinkful. Thinkful is a very serious online bootcamp that takes about 6 months to complete. I am currently two months into it right now and I have a good understanding of code. I plan on expanding my knowledge so I can understand all of the relevant computer languages to this day.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2> Projects </h2>

            <ul>
                <li> The screen shots above shows the beginging and first question in my quiz app that I created. The goal of this project was to test my skill to see if I can create a working quiz. To creat this quiz app, I had to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. </li>
              
            </ul>

                <li> The image above shows another project that I completed. The purpose of the project was to implement an API into an app and make it work flawlessly. I have chosen the OpenWeatherMap and FourSquare API to allow me to make my app display the weather of any city that is entered in the search bar. </li>
